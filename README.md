Clothespin is a Clothes Usage Tracking application, designed to make it easy to log what clothes and outfits you use on a day to day basis. I mostly did it for practice with designing a full backend and frontend in ASP.NET and in ReactJS respectively. I may come back to finish the statistics page eventually, but for now, the minimum viable product is present.

## Manage your Closet

Clothespin makes it easy to register your closet, and easy to browse it with its categories and subtypes. Plus, keep track of what clothes are clean, or dirty, or variation thereof.

## Log your outfits

Clothespin also makes it easy to log your outfit usage. Simply pick out your clothes for the day, and then pick from existing outfits, or create a new one on the spot.
